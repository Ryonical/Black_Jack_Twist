Black Jack Twist

A fast, fun 2D blackjack game with unexpected twists that keep every hand interesting.

Overview

Black Jack Twist is a 2D Unity game that reimagines the classic blackjack experience with creative “twist” modes that add humor, challenge, and unpredictability. At its core, it’s traditional blackjack — hit, stand, and try to reach 21 — but optional twists can alter the rules and keep players on their toes.

Players can enable text-based twists that add playful challenges or commands to follow while playing, creating a lighthearted and interactive experience. For those seeking something even more chaotic, the Alien Abduction mode introduces disappearing cards — each new draw carries a chance for your existing cards to vanish, turning the familiar card game into a test of luck and adaptability.

About the Project

Black Jack Twist was developed as a compact Unity project focused on creativity, polish, and gameplay variety. Created in roughly ten hours, it blends straightforward blackjack mechanics with experimental “twist” systems designed to make the experience more engaging and even physically interactive — at times suggesting playful actions like doing sit-ups mid-game.
